# Password Generator

# Description
In this weeks assignment I was tasked with creating a password generator using JavaScript and meets the following criteria:
- Password is between 8 and 120 characters
- Can include a uppercase character
- Can include a lowercase character
- Can include numbers
- Can include special characters

All of this is done by the user via window prompts and when the user finishes the prompts a password will be generated base on what the user answered in the prompts
